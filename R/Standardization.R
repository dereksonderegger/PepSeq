#' Standardize counts relative to uncleaved counts.
#'
#' There are two different ways to handles standardization of
#' cleaved vs uncleaved. For each of the cleaved and uncleaved counts,
#' we first convert to the proportion of reads, and then either look at the
#' difference in proportion (addititive) or the ratio of the proportions
#' (multiplicative). In the addititive case, we might want to normalize
#' the differences based on the differing amounts in the reference library.
#' @param cleaved The cleaved raw counts
#' @param uncleaved The uncleaved raw counts
#' @param ref The raw counts of the reference library. Ideally these should be
#'            identical, but the library likely isn't equally weighted
#' @param type Either `addititive`, `multiplicative`, or `complex`.
#' @param scale Should we scale to have the maximum between 100 and 1000?

#'                   ref       = c(3, 3, 2) )
#' with(df, standardize( cleaved, uncleaved, ref ) )
