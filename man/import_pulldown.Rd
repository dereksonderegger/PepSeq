\title{Reads an input pulldown .csv file and organizes it for visualization}
\usage{
import_pulldown(file, standardization_method = "additive",
  scale = TRUE, trim_proportion = 0.25, read_indicator = "X",
  protein_column = "protein_ID", position_column = "Peptide.start",
  Cleaved_Type_Indicators = c("Cl_", "Un_"))
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The input .csv, .xls, or .xlsx file. It can be a full path to a file or a
relative path from the current working directory.}

\item{standardization_method}{The method by which the cleaved and uncleaved read
counts are combined. Valid choices are 'additive' or
'multiplicative'. The default is additive.}

\item{scale}{Should we rescale the signal result so that the maximum signal
is between 100 and 1000.}

\item{trim_proportion}{In the rescaling, what percent of the large values should be
removed to get to a background rate.}

\item{read_indicator}{An argument that identifies what columns are responses
to be plotted. This could be either a vector of integers
or a character string (or vector of strings) that is at the beginning of all of the
column names of the response data.}

\item{protein_column}{A character string indicating which column denotes the protein.}

\item{position_column}{A character string indicating which column corresponds to the position within a protein.}
